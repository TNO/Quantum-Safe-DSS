/**
 * RFC 6960. "4.2.2.2.1. Revocation Checking of an Authorized Responder"
 *      A CA may specify that an OCSP client can trust a responder for the
 *      lifetime of the responder's certificate.  The CA does so by
 *      including the extension id-pkix-ocsp-nocheck.  This SHOULD be a
 *      non-critical extension.  The value of the extension SHALL be NULL.
 *      CAs issuing such a certificate should realize that a compromise of
 *      the responder's key is as serious as the compromise of a CA key
 *      used to sign CRLs, at least for the validity period of this
 *      certificate.  CAs may choose to issue this type of certificate with
 *      a very short lifetime and renew it frequently.
