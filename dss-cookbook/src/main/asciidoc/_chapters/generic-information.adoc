== Generic information

=== The Project

The *DSS (Digital Signature Service)* project is an open-source software library, aimed at providing implementation of the standards for Advanced Electronic Signature creation, augmentation and validation in line with European legislation and the eIDAS Regulation in particular.

This project is available in *Java* language.

=== Purpose of the document

This document describes some examples of how to develop in Java using the DSS framework. The aim is to show to the developers, in a progressive manner, the different uses of the framework. It will familiarize them with the code step by step.

=== Scope of the document

This document provides examples of code which allow easy handling of digital signatures. The examples are consistent with the Release {dssVersion} of DSS framework which can be downloaded via https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/wikis/display/DIGITAL/Digital+Signature+Service+-++DSS#DigitalSignatureServiceDSS-Releases[the webpage].

Three main features can be distinguished within the framework :

* The creation of a digital signature;
* The augmentation of a digital signature and;
* The validation of a digital signature.

In a more detailed manner the following concepts and features are addressed in this document:

* Forms of digital signatures: XAdES, CAdES, PAdES, JAdES and ASiC-S/ASiC-E;
* Formats of the signed documents: XML, JSON, PDF, DOC, TXT, ZIP, etc.;
* Packaging structures: enveloping, enveloped, detached and internally-detached;
* Profiles associated to each form of the digital signature;
* Trust management;
* Revocation data handling (OCSP and CRL sources);
* Certificate chain building;
* Signature validation and validation policy;
* Signature qualification;
* Validation reports (Simple, Detailed, ETSI Validation report);
* Management of signature tokens;
* Validation of the signing certificate;
* Timestamp creation;
* Timestamp validation and qualification;
* REST and SOAP webservices.

This is not an exhaustive list of all the possibilities offered by the framework and the proposed examples cover only the most useful features. However, to discover every detail of the operational principles of the framework, the JavaDoc is available within the source code.

NOTE: The DSS framework is actively maintained and new features will be released in the future.

=== Available demonstrations

With the framework, some demonstrations are provided:

* https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/DSS/webapp-demo/home[DSS online demo web application];
* <<DSSWebApp, Ready to use demo web application build>>;
* <<DSSStandaloneApp, JavaFX Standalone Application>>.

NOTE: European Commission does not intend to provide a service for a qualified signature creation, augmentation or validation through the available demonstrations. Usage of this demonstration should be limited to testing purposes only. European Commission claims no responsibility or liability whatsoever with regard to its usage. Please refer to the https://ec.europa.eu/info/legal-notice_en[legal notice] for further information.

The requirements and build instructions for DSS demonstrations can be found in the section <<DSSDemo>>.

WARNING: The demonstrations use a fake timestamp service (Mock) so that is not recommended for a production usage.
