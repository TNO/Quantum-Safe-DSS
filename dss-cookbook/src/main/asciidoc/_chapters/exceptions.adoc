== Exceptions

This section provides an overview of runtime Exceptions which are being thrown by various modules of DSS framework.

The following Exceptions can be obtained by the upper level:

* `NullPointerException` is thrown when a mandatory parameter has not been provided by the end-user to the method/process, requiring the property;
* `IllegalArgumentException` is thrown when a configuration of input parameters is not valid for the called method or some parameters cannot be used together (e.g. on a signature creation);
* `IllegalInputException` is thrown when a provided input document is not valid for the requested process and/or the configuration of parameters is not applicable for the given document;
* `UnsupportedOperationException` is thrown when a method is not implemented or its usage with the requested parameters is not (yet) supported;
* `IllegalStateException` is thrown when the requested method cannot be performed at the current method (e.g. another method shall be executed before);
* `DSSException` is thrown in case of an error obtained during the internal DSS process (e.g. data conversion, CRL/OCSP parsing, etc.);
* `DSSExternalResourceException` is thrown if an error occurs during a remote source request (AIA, CRL, OCSP requests, etc.);
* `DSSRemoteServiceException` is thrown in case of a request/response error within <<REST>> and <<SOAP>>;
* `SecurityConfigurationException` is thrown in case of invalid configuration of security features (see <<xmlSecurities>>).
