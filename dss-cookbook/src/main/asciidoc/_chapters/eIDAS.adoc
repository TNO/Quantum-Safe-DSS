=== Overview of certificates

==== Qualified status of certificate

The qualification status determination is based on ETSI TS 119 615 standard (cf. <<R14>>), that requires extraction of information from a certificate (i.e. QcStatements, see <<R25>>) and from a Trusted List (under TSPService corresponding to the certificate).

For more information about how to verify a certificate qualification status using DSS, please see the section <<CertificateValidation>>.

==== Type of certificate

A certificate can be for electronic signature, for electronic seal or for website authentication.

A qualified certificate shall comply with the eIDAS regulation <<R12>>, for each type:

 * *Qualified certificate for electronic signature* - shall comply with Annex I "REQUIREMENTS FOR QUALIFIED CERTIFICATES FOR ELECTRONIC SIGNATURES" of eIDAS Regulation;
* *Qualified certificate for electronic seals* - shall comply with Annex III "REQUIREMENTS FOR QUALIFIED CERTIFICATES FOR ELECTRONIC SEALS" of eIDAS Regulation;
* *Qualified certificate for web authentication* - shall comply with Annex IV "REQUIREMENTS FOR QUALIFIED CERTIFICATES FOR WEBSITE AUTHENTICATION" of eIDAS Regulation;

The certificate type determination is based on ETSI TS 119 615 standard (cf. <<R14>>). The validation process takes into account the following factors but not limited to:

 * The certificate type defined in QcStatements (see <<R25>>). One of the following values is supported:
    ** `qc-type-esign` (OID "0.4.0.1862.1.6.1") - identifies a certificate for a electronic signature;
    ** `qc-type-eseal` (OID "0.4.0.1862.1.6.2") - identifies a certificate for a electronic seal;
    ** `qc-type-web` (OID "0.4.0.1862.1.6.3") - identifies a certificate for a web authentication.
 * Information extracted from a TSP Service issued the certificate (from a Trusted List). The type of certificate may be 'overruled' based on the defined Qualifiers.

For more information about the validation process please see the ETSI TS 119 615 standard (cf. <<R14>>).

==== Certificate Qualification determination

In order to determine a type and qualification of certificate, the `CertificateVerifier` can be used, provided the relevant information extracted from a Trusted List(s).

An example of a qualification data extraction for a certificate, can be found below:

==== Qualified certificate for WebSite Authentication (QWAC)

With DSS, it is possible to validate a SSL certificate against the EUMS TL and the ETSI TS 119 615 (cf. <<R14>>) to determine if it is a Qualified certificate for WebSite Authentication (QWAC).

DSS provides a special class `SSLCertificateLoader` allowing to extract the SSL certificate chain from the given URL. The qualification verification is similar to the example defined in chapter <<CertificateQualificationDetermination>>.

=== Overview of AdES signatures

==== Type of AdES

eIDAS Regulation (cf. <<R12>>) defines the following types of an electronic signature:

* (simple) *electronic signature* - data in electronic form which is attached to or logically associated with other data in electronic form and which is used by the signatory to sign;
* *advanced electronic signature* - an electronic signature which meets the requirements set out in Article 26 of eIDAS Regulation <<R12>>;
* *qualified electronic signature* - an advanced electronic signature that is created by a qualified electronic signature creation device, and which is based on a qualified certificate for electronic signatures.

==== Qualified status of AdES signature

To have a qualified status an electronic signature/seal shall satisfy the following requirements but not limited to:

 * the signing-certificate shall be qualified at the certificate's issuance time;
 * the signing-certificate shall be qualified at the best-signature-time;
 * the signing-certificate shall have a type of for eSignature or for eSeal, respectively to the signature type;
 * the signature shall be created using Qualified Signature Creation Device (QSCD).

==== Signature Qualification determination

In order to determine a type and qualification of a signature, an instance of `SignedDocumentValidator` can be used, provided the relevant information is extracted from a Trusted List(s).

An example of a qualification data extraction for a signature, can be found below:

=== Verifying the qualified status of timestamp

ETSI TS 119 615 (<<R14>>) specifies standardized procedures for the determination of the qualification of a timestamp.
DSS is able to determine a qualification level of a timestamp if a relative information about TrustServiceProviders is provided to a certificate verifier (loaded automatically to a trusted certificate source with <<tlValidationJob>>).

Three qualification levels are supported by DSS and can be obtained :

* `QTSA` (issued from a granted trust service with TSA/QTST type at the timestamp production time);
* `TSA` any other from a known trust anchor;
* `N/A` for others.

In order to determine a type and qualification of signature, an instance of `DetachedTimestampValidator` can be used for a detached CMS time-stamp verification, provided the relevant information extracted from a Trusted List(s).

NOTE: For standalone time-stamps within different containers (e.g. PDF or ASiC) a corresponding instance of a `TimestampValidator` shall be used.

The following example verifies the qualification level of a timestamp:
