        <PolicyDescription>Validate electronic signatures and indicates whether they are Advanced electronic Signatures (AdES), AdES supported by a Qualified Certificate (AdES/QC) or a
                Qualified electronic Signature (QES). All certificates and their related chains supporting the signatures are validated against the EU Member State Trusted Lists (this includes
                signer's certificate and certificates used to validate certificate validity status services - CRLs, OCSP, and time-stamps).

    <Semantic Key="TOTAL_FAILED">The signature validation process results into TOTAL-FAILED because the format-check failed, cryptographic checks of the signature failed (including checks of hashes of individual data objects that have been signed indirectly) or it has been proven that the signing certificate was invalid at the time of generation of the signature.</Semantic>
    <Semantic Key="SIG_CRYPTO_FAILURE">The signature validation process results into TOTAL-FAILED because the signature value in the signature could not be verified using the signers public key in the signing certificate.</Semantic>
